<h1>Seeking Podcast Collaborators</h1>
<p>This project is designed to go beyond one-way communication via ebook or audiobook and serve as a true retrospective on the trends shaping Human-Centered Interaction each quarter.</p>
<p>I'm actively seeking podcast collaborators who share my passion for this field. I'd love to engage with other curious minds to discuss what worked well, what needs improvement, and what's next in our industry.</p>
<p>If any of this quarter's topics resonated with you and you'd like to explore them further in a podcast conversation, I encourage you to <a href="/contact">reach out to me</a>. Let's create meaningful dialogue together about the evolving landscape of Human-Centered Interaction.</p>
